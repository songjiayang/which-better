# Which Better

Help you to choose the better GitHub repositories.

Rate score by github stars, last push date and the number of contributors.

Note: more smaller score, more better.

## Usage

```
$ which-better -r golang/dep,Masterminds/glide,tools/godep,kardianos/govendor,pote/gpm

golang/dep: 4
Masterminds/glide: 5
tools/godep: 11
kardianos/govendor: 11
pote/gpm: 14
```

As the result, `golang/dep` and `Masterminds/glide` are better.
